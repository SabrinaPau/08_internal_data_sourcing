/* 
 * Welcome to Advanced SQL!
 * This document includes practical examples of all advanced SQL commands you will learn in this lecture.

 * If you have 2 screens:
 * Open the zoom call with the presentation on one screen and DBeaver with this file on your other screen.

 * If you have 1 screen:
 * Open and resize the zoom call with the presentation to fit on one half and DBeaver with this file open on the other.

 * How to use this file:
 * This file includes practical examples already pre-coded for you.
 * They will show you how they can be applied in reality and how the output changes based on each SQL command.
 * To execute an example simply click anywhere in the query and press the control and ‚Æê button simoultaneously.
 * This shortcut will execute the SQL statement and return the output below as a table.

 * The lecture will cover a lot of SQL commands, but don't worry we have a lot of practical exercises prepared for you.
 * With the exercises you will build up your SQL skills in no time!

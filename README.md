# Connecting to PostgreSQL in Python
In this repository you're going to learn how to connect to PostgreSQL and retrieve its data using Python.

## Why internal data sourcing?
The two main tools of Data Analysts are SQL and Python. Internal data is often stored in a database. Thus, knowing how to combine SQL and Python in order to access, retrieve and manipulate the data is essential!
## Tasks
Create a new conda environment using the environment.yml file.  
Use your terminal to navigate to your folder and run the following command:  
```conda env create -f environment.yml```  

Activate your new environment by typing:  
```conda activate sql-practice```

Please work in pairs through all the notebooks in this particular order: 

Keep in mind, you succeed better as a team. There are NO stupid questions! If you already feel comfortable with the concepts, you might even learn more from teaching them!

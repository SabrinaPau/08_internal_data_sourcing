/* 4. Combine the 'faa' and 'name' column in the airports table so that your output looks as follows: 'faa - name'.
 *    Please provide the query below.

/* 9. Perform all of the following steps in ONE query:
 *    1. Query the 'lat' and 'lon' column with only one decimal using string functions
 *    2. Merge the two columns into a new column having the structure: lat;lon
 * 	  3. Split the column into two columns called lat and lon again
 *    Please provide the query and answer below.
 */

/* 10. Return a list of unique country names from the airports table that have 'land' in their name but NOT 'Island'.

    "# SQL in Python - Connecting to and retrieving data from PostgreSQL\n",
    "We want to bring our tools together and use python and SQL in one place. Up to now, you have connected to a SQL database by using a SQL client such as DBeaver.  \n",
    "DBeaver allows you to connect to databases to run SQL queries against the database, create new tables and populate them with data as well as retrieving the data. This is only one tool that allows you to connect. There are many others including python.  \n",
    "Often you have data on your local machine that we have manipulated in python, you have performed data cleaning procedures to bring your data into shape. This process can be considered a data pipeline.  \n",
    "The final step in the workflow is in many cases saving the output of your data pipeline to a database for future use by yourself or others.\n",
    "Fortunately, we can connect to the database from Python directly, eliminating the need for a separate SQL client. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**This notebook will teach you how to connect to a database and query its data in Python directly, as well as how to automate the process using custom functions and modules.**"

    "Therefor we will give you hints about what code to write. You will not need to create any new code blocks. In the code blocks that are there there will be 3 different situations:  \n",
    "1. The code is complete and will run.  \n",
    "2. The code block contains only a comment that tells you what code to write. It will be pretty obvious what you need to type.  \n",

    "  \n",
    "In this repository ```/notebooks``` folder, you can find a file called env.md.  This is a template that you can use to save the data in the format we need.\n",

The connection parameters in this file can be read by python and will be used as key-value-pairs and saved as environment variables.  \n",

This might seem a little complex right now as we introduce two extra steps to get the credentials but this will give us room to do more exciting stuff in the future, and it should become more clear as we use it more..."

    "Now imagine you have defined the get_data() and get_dataframe() functions in only one of your jupyter notebooks, but you have multiple notebooks in your repository where you would like to use this function.\n",
    "To be able to do that you would have to add the function definition to each notebook. In reality you would simply duplicate your code over and over, which should always be avoided. While this wouldn't mean the end of the world, the real problem occurs if we ever wanted to change the connection details inside the function. In that case, we would have to find and change each function definition in each file, which not only increases the likelihood of errors but could become a tedious unnecessarily time consuming task.  \n",

    "Now that we know about the downsides, can you think of a another, better solution? If you don't have any idea, think about Python packages or more specifically about why and how we use them.  \n",

You're probably thinking: \"But we don't have a package and we also don't want to create a package for just function and publish it to the official Python library\". That's true but fortunately, we don't have to. Instead we can use a built-in Python functionality called <ins>modules</ins>.    \n",

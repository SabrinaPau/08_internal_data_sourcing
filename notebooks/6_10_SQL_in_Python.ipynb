    "# SQL in Python - Connecting to and retrieving data from PostgreSQL\n",
    "We want to bring our tools together and use python and SQL in one place. Up to now, you have connected to a SQL database by using a SQL client such as DBeaver, let's change that and get python connected and running queries. \n",
    " \n",
    "In most organisations, data is stored in SQL databases, so in order to work with this locally you run SQL queries to get the data. You could also then use python to manipulate this data further and perhaps even send the transformed data back to the database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Loading data from a source, cleaning and augmenting it before saving it can be considered a data pipeline. Which is a tool that allows you to run a process over and over again and process data in a repeatable, structured way. Once you have built this data pipeline it could be something you want to reuse in other notebooks or projects. This is done by saving your scripts in your own module to save functions to be imported into other notebooks.  So we see the power of being able to work with SQL directly inside python scripts and save those scripts for use in further projects.\n",

We defined the functions once and then were able to call those functions as we liked with different sql queries as inputs to get the results we wanted. But we have the limitation that these functions only live in this notebook. What if we have multiple jupyter notebooks in our repository and we want to use this in other notebooks as well? How could we do that?  \n",

    "The naive approach is to simply copy paste your code over and over, which should always be avoided. One reason is this could create a lot of maintenance work if the connection details or other changes needed to be made to the function. You would have to find and change each function definition in each file, which not only increases the likelihood of errors but could become a tedious unnecessarily time consuming task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The more elegant approach is to create your own module (or package). You have already lots of experience importing modules like pandas or matplotlib which give you access to new functions that you need for your programs. And this is what we want to build, a module that contains functions that we can use in our scripts. The only difference is instead of using conda to install these packages, you write them yourself in a python script file. We will now create a python module and use it to see how this works.\n",

    "2. Write the code to import all Python packages used in the ```get_data()``` and ```get_dataframe()``` functions\n",

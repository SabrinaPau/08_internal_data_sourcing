    "# SQL in Python - Connecting to and retrieving data from PostgreSQL\n",
    "We want to bring our tools together and use python and SQL in one place. Up to now, you have connected to a SQL database by using a SQL client such as DBeaver, let's change that and get python connected and running queries. \n",
    " \n",
    "In most organisations, data is stored in SQL databases, so in order to work with this locally you run SQL queries to get the data. You could also then use python to manipulate this data further and perhaps even send the transformed data back to the database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Loading data from a source, cleaning and augmenting it before saving it can be considered a data pipeline. Which is a tool that allows you to run a process over and over again and process data in a repeatable, structured way. Once you have built this data pipeline it could be something you want to reuse in other notebooks or projects. This is done by saving your scripts in your own module to save functions to be imported into other notebooks.  So we see the power of being able to work with SQL directly inside python scripts and save those scripts for use in further projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook will teach you how to connect to a database and query its data in Python directly, as well as how to store your functions that enable this as a modules.**"

    "Therefore we will give you hints about what code to write. You will not need to create any new code blocks. In the code blocks that are there there will be 3 different cases:  \n",
    "1. The code is complete and will run.  \n",
    "2. The code block contains only a comment that tells you what code to write. We try to make it pretty clear what you need to type.  \n",

    "We will now look into how to turn these helpful functions into reusable tools that you can use in additional notebooks without having to type out the code each time.\n",
    "First, lets think about at what we have done so far. In this notebook we created functions ```get_data()``` and ```get_dataframe()``` that create an engine and run a query to return the results. We defined the functions once and then were able to call those functions as we liked with different sql queries as inputs to get the results we wanted. But we have the limitation that these functions only live in this notebook. What if we have multiple jupyter notebooks in our repository and we want to use this in other notebooks as well? How could we do that?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The naive approach is to simply copy paste your code over and over, which should always be avoided. One reason is this could create a lot of maintenance work if the connection details or other changes needed to be made to the function. You would have to find and change each function definition in each file, which not only increases the likelihood of errors but could become a tedious unnecessarily time consuming task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The more elegant approach is to create your own module (or package). You have already lots of experience importing modules like pandas or matplotlib which give you access to new functions that you need for your programs. And this is what we want to build, a module that contains functions that we can use in our scripts. The only difference is instead of using conda to install these packages, you write them yourself in a python script file. We will now create a python module and use it to see how this works.\n",

    "\n",
    "Please perform the following three steps:\n",
    "1. Open the ```sql_functions.py``` in VS Code (you can use the split screen tool for this)\n",
    "2. Write the code to import all Python packages used in the ```get_data()``` and ```get_dataframe()``` functions\n",
    "3. Copy paste the code you wrote in this notebook that define the get_data() and get_dataframe() functions into the ```sql_functions.py``` file\n",
    "4. save the sql_function.py file\n",

    "1. We will, in this notebook, write the code to import the python file into this jupyter notebook, giving it an alias  \n",
    "2. We will then execute the get_data() function to retrieve data, proving it has worked  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: To make sure we're using the function from our sql_functions.py module and not the one we defined earlier in this jupyter notebook we need to give the imported package an alias and use it to reference the get_data() function**"

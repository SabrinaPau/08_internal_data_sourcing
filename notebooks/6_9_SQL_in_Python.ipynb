    "# SQL in Python - Connecting to and retrieving data from PostgreSQL\n",
    "Previously, you have learned how to connect to a SQL database by using a SQL client such as DBeaver.  \n",
    "Apart from connecting to databases, DBeaver also allows you to run SQL queries against the database, create new tables and populate them with data as well as retrieving the data.  \n",
    "Populating tables with data that you have locally on your machine usually requires you to save it in a file, like a CSV, and import it using the DBeaver UI.  \n",
    "Often, before you reached the final step of uploading your dataset, you have performed data cleaning procedures to bring your data into shape.  \n",
    "This is usually done in Python (or R). This means we would import the data into Python, clean it, export it to a CSV file, import it into DBeaver and upload the data into the database.  \n",
    "This process requires multiple steps and more than one software. Fortunately, we can reduce the steps by connecting to the database from Python directly, eliminating the need for a separate SQL client. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**This notebook will not only teach you how to connect to a database and query its data in Python directly, but also how to automate the process using custom functions and modules.**"

    "## Automating data retrieval using a Python module\n",
    "Before I will tell how to make your function even more powerful, let's take a step back and look at the prerequisites for using the get_data() function and what limitations apply.  \n",
    "In order to use our get_data() function anywhere in our jupyter notebook, we need to define it once with the correct connection details.  \n",
    "But what if we have multiple jupyter notebooks in our repository and we want to use this in other notebooks as well? How could we do that?  \n",
    "As with all things in life: <ins>it depends</ins>.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that when you start a jupyter notebook, you simultaneously start a kernel that will then load your virtual environment and execute any Python code you feed it.  \n",
    "Every package you load and every function you define will be available in that jupyter notebook only.  \n",
    "Now imagine you have defined the get_data() function in only one of your jupyter notebooks, but you have multiple notebooks in your repository where you would like to use this function.\n",
    "To be able to do that you would have to add the function definition to each notebook. In reality you would simply duplicate your code over and over, which should always be avoided. While this wouldn't mean the end of the world, the real problem occurs if we ever wanted to change the connection details inside the function. In that case, we would have to find and change each function definition in each file, which not only increases the likelihood of errors but could become a tedious unnecessarily time consuming task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know about the downsides, can you think of a another, better solution? If you don't have any idea, think about Python packages or more specifically about why and how we use them.  \n",
    "The answer is, we import Python packages because they include predefined functions that we can then use in any of our Python scripts, which is exactly what we want to do with our function. You're probably thinking: \"But we don't have a package and we also don't want to create a package for just function and publish it to the offical Python library\". That's true but fortunately, we don't have to. Instead we can use a built-in Python functionality called <ins>modules</ins>.    \n",
    "Instead of giving you a detailed explanation what modules are and what they do, let's create a python module and use it instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "Please perform the following steps:\n",
    "1. Open sql.py and import all Python packages necessary for the get_data() function to work\n",
    "2. Insert the definition of the get_data() function\n",
    "3. Import the Python file into this jupyter notebook below the same way you normally import packages\n",
    "4. Execute the get_data() function\n",
